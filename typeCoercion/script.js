// coercion - принуждение, насилие

// type coercion in js is represnted by '=='

// if there are different types try to coerse one of them

// using  '===' we say to js to be explicit and do exactly what we tell it

// **cool thing, whenever we use values which are not booleans insile if or while statements language will try to coerce it to a boolean

// for example
// 0 - false
// 1 - true
